## Poke React Hooks and Pose.Js Web App.


### `What is it?`
This web app was created based on another app I created before, I wanted to re-recreate it and add a new animation feature, dragging cards and hooks from react. 

### `Tech used for this project`
React.Js(HOOKS)
Semantic-UI
Pose.Js
Rest API
### `Why did I use this tech?`
I wanted to check how easier or harder It was to do exacly the same app using only functional components(Hooks) instead of using classes .  To add styling I used to implement Material-UI but I found more ways to change functionallity using Semantic-Ui. 
And the effect you may see when draggin a poke card is done with Pose.Js.

### `POKE API`
All the data was gotten from POKE API. PUBLIC API.

### `Do you want to run this project?`

Just donwload the project and run in using yarn start or npm start, after being installed.
